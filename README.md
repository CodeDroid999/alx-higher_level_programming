# alx-higher_level_programming
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python.

## What Does High-Level Language (HLL) Mean?
A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.
